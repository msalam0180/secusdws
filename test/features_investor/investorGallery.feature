Feature: Gallery Slideshow
  As a content creator
  I would like to be able to create galleries around different
  events/topics/etc and select existing videos to be displayed
   in that gallery so that end users can quickly see all related media

Background:

  Given I create "media" of type "video":
    | field_media_video_file | field_video_origin | field_video                                 | mid     | field_caption  | field_transcript |
    | BEHAT Bird Image       | YouTube or Vimeo   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf9BpXOtMcc | 112312  | Bird caption   | Transcript       |
    | BEHAT Rabbit Image     | YouTube or Vimeo   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsSOMSTsM0o | 221313  | Rabbit caption |                  |
    | BEHAT Cat Image        | YouTube or Vimeo   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIobikJiTuU | 312123  |                |                  |
    | BEHAT Dog Image        | YouTube or Vimeo   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf9BpXOtMcc | 412313  | Dog caption    |                  |
    And I create "media" of type "image":
      | name              | field_media_image      | mid    | field_caption  |
      | Gold Pig Tail     | behat-gold-pig.png     | 111112 | Pig Caption    |
      | Black Rabbit Tail | behat-black_rabbit.jpg | 111113 | Rabbit Caption |
    And I create "media" of type "audio":
      | field_media_audio_file | mid    | field_caption | field_transcript   | field_thumbnail    |
      | behat-zgbh0016.mp3     | 111115 | sampleaudio   | Testforaddingaudio | behat-bird.gif     |
      | behat-kuda0001.mp3     | 111116 | Ascentaudio   | Audio file         | behat-cat.png      |
      | behat-Ascent.wav       | 111117 | WAVaudio      | wavAudio file      | behat-gold-pig.png |
