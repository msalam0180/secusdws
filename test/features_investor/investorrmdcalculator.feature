Scenario Outline: RMD Calculations
  Given I am on "/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/required-minimum-distribution-calculator"
  When I fill in "Previous Year-End Account Balance" with "<previousyear>"
    And I select "<age_at_year_end>" from "Age at Year-End"
    And I scroll to the bottom
    And I press the "Calculate" button
    And I wait for ajax to finish
    And I scroll to the bottom
    And I should see the text "Results"
    And I wait for ajax to finish
  Then I should see the text "<withdrawal_factor>"
    And I should see the text "<required_minimum_distribution>"

  Examples:
     | previousyear | age_at_year_end | withdrawal_factor | required_minimum_distribution |
     | 5000000      | 72              | 27.4              | $182,481.75                   |
