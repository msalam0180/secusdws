Feature: Test Person Content Type
  As a Content Creator
  I want to be able to create person content
  So that visitors to SEC.gov can learn about the person

  @api @javascript
  Scenario: Create Person Content Through the UI
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Sitebuilder" role
    When I visit "/node/add/secperson"
      And I fill in "John Doe Behat" for "Title"
      And I fill in the following:
        | First Name | John  |
        | Last Name  | Behat |
      And I type "John Doe Behat was named Automation Tester of the SEC.GOV O&M Team in June 2018. Before joining the SEC.GOV O&M Team, Mr. Behat spent 3 years working on Behat. Mr. Behat received his Behat certification online." in the "Body" WYSIWYG editor
      And I select "Other" from "Position Category"
      And I check "Current Position"
      And I fill in "Director of Behat" for "Position Title"
      And I fill in the following:
        | field_position_history_paragraph[0][subform][field_from][0][value][date] | 06-07-2018 |
      And I attach the file "behat-person.gif" to "Photo"
      And I wait for ajax to finish
      And I fill in "Alternative text" with "Mr. Behat"
      And I publish it
    Then I should see the text "John Behat Director of Behat"
      And I should see the "img" element with the "alt" attribute set to "Mr. Behat" in the "contentarea" region
