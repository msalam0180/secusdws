# All Release Import tests depends on certain files. To make things easier, all tests use the same pdf files.
# By default the wupdate.json file works for Trading Ssupensions. On testing other imports the wupdate.json file needs to be rename current and replace wupdate.json file.
# For example - testing: [Release Import Administrative Proceedings Using JSON and PDF Files] rename wupdate.json to wupdate-ts.json and wupdate-ap.json to wupdate.json before testing.
