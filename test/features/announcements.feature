Feature: Verify Articles with PDF in announcement and structure data list view
  As a user of the site
  I want to be able to upload PDF
  So that when I click on the link it should open a PDF

@api @javascript
Scenario: Verify PDF file opens when the link is clicked from the list view for announcement
  Given  I create "media" of type "static_file":
      | name              | field_display_title  | field_media_file        | field_description_abstract | status |
      | Behat Test File 1 | static file          | behat-file_im_ann.pdf   | This is description abs    | 1      |
      | Behat Test File 2 | static file          | behat-file_ocie_ann.pdf | This is description abs    | 1      |
      | Behat Test File 3 | static file          | behat-file_st_news.pdf  | This is description abs    | 1      |
    And "secarticle" content:
      | title                                                                                           | field_display_title                                                     | field_list_page_det_secarticle | field_publish_date  | field_date          | status | field_article_type_secarticle | field_primary_division_office           | field_release_number | field_audience | field_act              |
