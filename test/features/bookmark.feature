When I visit "/admin/content"
  And I fill in "publishex" for "edit-key"
  And I press "Filter"
  And I wait for AJAX to finish
  And I click "Edit" in the "publishex101" row
  And I press "Flags"
  And I check "edit-flag-bookmark"
  And I publish it
Then I should see the text "Individual Defendant publishex101 has been updated"
  And I visit "/admin/bookmarks"
  And I should see the link "publishex101"
