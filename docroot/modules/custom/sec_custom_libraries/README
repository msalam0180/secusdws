Prerequisites
================================================================================
You will need NPM, Grunt CLI, RVM, Bundler, and Bower:

For NPM, install the Node.js installer (https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.6.0/node-v4.6.0.pkg)

After that is installed, Grunt CLI  can be installed:

$ npm install -g grunt-cli

Use RVM to manage your Ruby versions:

https://rvm.io/rvm/install

And to install Bundler:

$ sudo gem update
$ sudo gem install bundler -n /usr/local/bin

Installing Bower:
$ npm install -g bower

Installing project dependencies
================================================================================
$ npm install

Bower dependencies:
$ bower install

And finally the Ruby dependancies:

$ bundle install

* If you see a SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN error, you will have to
disconnect from the SEC network.

Instructions for adding a new Library:
================================================================================
1. Add a new entry in the sec_custom_libraries.libraries.yml file in the
   following format:

   library_name:
     version: 1.0
     js:
       components/scripts/library-name.js: {}
       //path/to/cdn/script.js: { type: external }
     css:
       layout:
         components/stylesheets/library-name.css: {}

2. Place your JavaScript file(s) in components/scripts
3. This module uses Grunt and Comass to compile SASS to CSS. Create a .SCSS file
   in the components/sass directory. To compile or watch changes to the SASS
   source file, execute 'grunt' or 'grunt watch' from the sec_custom_libraries
   module directory.
4. Edit sec_custom_libraries.module. In the sec_custom_libraries_page_attachments_alter
   function, add a case statement for your page's path. Note: be sure to add a
   path alias to the new page if one does not exist.
5. Flush Drupal cache with 'drush cr' to view changes in the browser.
6. If you need to alter the page template in any way (i.e. to remove a region),
   you can do so in the sec_custom_libraries_preprocess_page function located in
   the sec_custom_libraries.module file.
