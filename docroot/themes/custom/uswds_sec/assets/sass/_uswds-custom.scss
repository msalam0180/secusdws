// Note on undocumented components: The USWDS Developer said "The UX research and guidance was out-of-date so that's why it didn't make it in the original 2x website launch. We have an issue to document components like [usa-graphic-list] and hero, but we just got a UX researcher again and she's working on stuff that backed up. For undocumented components; we not only want to add them but we want to improve their features."
